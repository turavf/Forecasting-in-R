# Forecasting-in-R
Forecasting techniques in R Studio

Time series project consisting of analysing an economic or financial time series.

The Code is destributed in 3 parts:

PART 1: Description of time series and Descriptive Analysis.

PART 2: In-Sample Analysis. Use of 80% of the sample to estimate an appropiate time series model for the time series with multiple models. Using tables and plots to report parameter estimates, goodness-of-fit indices, fitted values, residuals and residual diagnostics.

PART 3: Out-of-Sample prediction. Use of 20% of the sample to carry out a forecasting exercise to assess the forecasting ability of our models.
